        <p>This site will be for the computer scienece students of Concordia St. Paul.  It will be a registration for graduation party (Not a real party, don't get excited) for the
            students that graduate each given year.  The party will be held in the second week of June after graduation and will take place in Jamaica.  The purpose of the party will
            to celebrate the accomplishment of graduating from a rather challenging course of study.
