        <p>This site will be for the computer scienece students of Concordia St. Paul.  It will be a registration for graduation party (Not a real party, don't get excited) for the
            students that graduate each given year.  The party will be held in the second week of June after graduation and will take place in Jamaica.  The purpose of the party will
            to celebrate the accomplishment of graduating from a rather challenging course of study.
        </p></br>
        <p>One stored procedure has been added and named getStudentList.  It provides a list of the students ordered by their name in ascending order.  The procedure has been 
            added to the localhost database through the command prompt however it was not added to the published database because connecting to it through the command console isn't 
            possible and I need to download other software in order to manage that database, I'm not certain it will even let me add the stored procedure but I try to avoid downloading 
            any uneccessary software.  The stored procedure was written by me on December 5th 2021.
